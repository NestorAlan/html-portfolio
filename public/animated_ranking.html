<h1>My Favourites Animated Movies or Series by Néstor A. López</h1>

<h2>My top 3 animated movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Ratatouile</h3>
<p>
  It's indescribable what Pixar Animation Studios did with this movie. That
  Ego's final monologue it's now part of the popular culture. <br />
  Just amazing.
  <br />
  <br />
  The funny thing here is that, when I saw it for first time, I really hated the
  movie. For me was like... No action it's equivalent to garbage. Oh, boy...
</p>

<h3>Spetacular Spider-Man</h3>
<p>
  Since I'm conscious, I've always loved Spider-Man. It's and will be my
  favorite super hero. Now imagine what I thought when I watch this series.
  Everyone of the plots are "Cheff-Kiss", and everyone of them yell us the
  unforgottable lesson "«Whit great power, comes great responsability»"
  <br />
  It's a shame that was canceled :'(
</p>

<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>
  Jesuschrist, the score and soundtrack are from another world! Everytime I
  heard it, gives me chills... God, don't let the director spoil the live action
  version
</p>
