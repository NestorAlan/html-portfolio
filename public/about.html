  Hey, fellas! I want you to know that sometimes it's easier to formulate a
  description for Instagram, Twitter or Facebook than for a personal page
  hahaha.
</p>

<p>
  So, my name is Néstor. Right now, I'm studying and practicing to start a
  career in computer engineering or electronics... I haven't quite decided yet
  (although I'm opting for computer engineering). My plan is that for the next
  few years I will be working at <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">JPL</a>,
  because, ever since I heard about the
  <a href="https://dart.jhuapl.edu/">DART</a>
  mission on planetary defense (which sounds exactly like a summary of a movie
  hahaha), I have wanted to work more closely on interesting, violent, and
  community projects like this. I may still be in my 20's, but now I'd rather
  start late, than never start at all.

  Greetings, folks! <br />
  Thanks a lot for reading <3
